    <h1 class="main-hobby">Karting Enthusiast</h1>
    <p class="hobby-text"> I've been passionate about karting since I was 9 years old. The thrill of speed and the excitement of
      competition have always drawn me to the track, where I push myself to navigate tight corners and perfect
      my racing technique. Over the years, I've had the privilege of competing and winning two city cups, which
      were some of my proudest moments. Nowadays, I continue karting more casually, enjoying the ride and the
      freedom it brings without the pressure of competition.</p>
